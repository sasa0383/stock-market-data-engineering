- **Resource Efficiency**: More efficient resource utilization compared to virtual machines.
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, reducing environment-specific issues.
- **Rapid Deployment**: Enables quick deployment and scaling of services.

### 6. Batch Processing Model

**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency**: Processing data in batches is more efficient for large volumes of historical data.
- **Simplicity**: Batch processing is conceptually simpler than real-time streaming.
- **Resource Planning**: Resource requirements are more predictable and can be scheduled during off-peak hours.
- **Comprehensive Processing**: Entire datasets can be processed together, enabling global optimizations.
- **Alignment with Requirements**: Matches the quarterly update cycle of the machine learning application.
