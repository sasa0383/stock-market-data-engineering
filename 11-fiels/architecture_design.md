# Batch-Processing Data Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture design for our batch-processing data system for stock market data. The architecture is designed to be reliable, scalable, and maintainable, with appropriate security, governance, and protection measures.

## System Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern, with each component responsible for a specific function in the data pipeline. The architecture is designed to process stock market data in batches, with quarterly updates to the machine learning model.

## Microservices Components

### 1. Producer Service
- **Responsibility**: Data ingestion from external sources
- **Implementation**: Python-based service using Kafka producer API
- **Key Functions**:
  - Fetch stock market data from Yahoo Finance API
  - Transform data into standardized format
  - Publish data to Kafka topics
- **Docker Image**: `python:3.10-slim` with custom configuration
- **Batch Schedule**: Quarterly data collection for historical data

### 2. Kafka Broker
- **Responsibility**: Message queuing and data buffering
- **Implementation**: Apache Kafka with Zookeeper
- **Key Functions**:
  - Decouple data producers from consumers
  - Buffer data during processing spikes
  - Ensure data durability with replication
- **Docker Images**: 
  - `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.3.0`
  - `confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.3.0`
- **Topics**:
  - `raw-stock-data`: Raw stock market data
  - `processed-stock-data`: Processed and validated data

### 3. Consumer Batch Processing
- **Responsibility**: Data processing and transformation
- **Implementation**: Apache Spark
- **Key Functions**:
  - Clean and validate data
  - Calculate financial indicators
  - Perform feature engineering
- **Docker Image**: `bitnami/spark:3.3.2`
- **Batch Schedule**: Quarterly processing aligned with data collection

### 4. Data Storage
- **Responsibility**: Persistent storage of processed data
- **Implementation**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Elasticsearch for fast queries
- **Key Functions**:
  - Store processed stock market data
  - Support complex queries for analytics
  - Maintain historical data
- **Docker Images**: 
  - `postgres:15.2`
  - `elasticsearch:8.6.0`
- **Schema Design**:
  - Time-series optimized tables
  - Partitioning by time periods
  - Appropriate indexing for query performance

### 5. Dashboard Service
- **Responsibility**: Data visualization and monitoring
- **Implementation**: Flask/FastAPI with Grafana
- **Key Functions**:
  - Visualize stock market trends
  - Monitor system performance
  - Provide API for frontend applications
- **Docker Images**:
  - `python:3.10-slim` with Flask/FastAPI
  - `grafana/grafana:9.3.6`

### 6. Workflow Orchestration
- **Responsibility**: Scheduling and monitoring batch jobs
- **Implementation**: Apache Airflow
- **Key Functions**:
  - Schedule data ingestion jobs
  - Coordinate processing workflows
  - Monitor job execution
  - Handle failures and retries
- **Docker Image**: `apache/airflow:2.5.1`
- **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**:
  - Data ingestion workflow
  - Data processing workflow
  - Data aggregation workflow

## Data Flow

### 1. Ingestion Phase
- Producer service fetches stock market data from Yahoo Finance API
- Data is published to Kafka topic `raw-stock-data`
- Data is stored in its raw form for audit and replay capabilities

### 2. Processing Phase
- Spark batch jobs consume data from Kafka topic `raw-stock-data`
- Data is cleaned, validated, and transformed
- Financial indicators are calculated
- Processed data is published to Kafka topic `processed-stock-data`

### 3. Storage Phase
- Processed data is consumed from Kafka topic `processed-stock-data`
- Data is stored in PostgreSQL for structured queries
- Data is indexed in Elasticsearch for fast search and analytics

### 4. Aggregation Phase
- Spark batch jobs aggregate data at different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Aggregated data is stored in PostgreSQL
- Aggregated data is made available for the machine learning application

### 5. Delivery Phase
- Dashboard service provides visualizations and API access
- Machine learning application consumes aggregated data for model training

## Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability

### Reliability
- **Data Replication**: Kafka topics with replication factor of 3
- **Fault Tolerance**: Spark's resilient distributed datasets (RDDs)
- **Idempotent Processing**: Unique message IDs and deduplication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring

- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of all components and workflows
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

## Data Security, Governance, and Protection

### Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for service authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL for data in transit, encryption at rest
- **Network Security**: Container network policies for isolation
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Governance
- **Data Cataloging**: Metadata repository for data assets
- **Data Quality**: Validation rules and quality monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of data access and changes
- **Policy Management**: Documented data policies and automated enforcement

### Protection
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular automated backups with verification
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege
- **Data Masking**: Tokenization of sensitive fields
- **Resilience**: Multi-region deployment for critical components

## Implementation Considerations

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Git for version control
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes for container orchestration (future consideration)
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana

### Deployment Strategy
- Initial deployment on local development environment
- Phased approach to production deployment
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates

## Conclusion

This architecture design provides a solid foundation for our batch-processing data system. It leverages industry-standard components and follows best practices for reliability, scalability, and maintainability. The microservices approach allows for independent development and deployment of components, while the batch processing model aligns with the quarterly update requirements of the machine learning application.

Next steps include documenting specific architecture decisions, creating a detailed implementation plan, and preparing for the development phase.
