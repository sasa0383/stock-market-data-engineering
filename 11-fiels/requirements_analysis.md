# Project Requirements Analysis: Batch-Processing Data Architecture

## Project Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for building a batch-processing-based data architecture for a data-intensive machine learning application. The system will serve as the backend infrastructure for ingesting, storing, processing, and aggregating large volumes of data for quarterly machine learning model updates.

## Key Requirements

### System Functionality
1. **Data Ingestion**: The system must be capable of ingesting massive amounts of data from external sources.
2. **Data Storage**: The system must store data effectively and efficiently.
3. **Data Pre-processing**: The system must pre-process parts of the ingested data.
4. **Data Aggregation**: The system must aggregate data for direct usage in a machine learning application.
5. **Batch Processing**: The system must be designed for batch processing rather than real-time processing, as the frontend ML application runs quarterly.

### System Qualities
1. **Reliability**: The system must be reliable, ensuring data integrity and availability.
2. **Scalability**: The system must be scalable to handle growing data volumes.
3. **Maintainability**: The system must be maintainable, allowing for updates and modifications.
4. **Security**: The system must implement data security measures.
5. **Governance**: The system must follow data governance principles.
6. **Protection**: The system must protect data from unauthorized access or corruption.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Microservices Architecture**: The system must be designed as isolated and independent microservices.
2. **Containerization**: The system must use Docker for containerization.
3. **Version Control**: The system must use version control (e.g., GitHub).
4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The system should implement IaC principles where possible.
5. **Sample Data**: The system must use a sample dataset with at least 1,000,000 data points that include timestamps.

## Project Structure
Based on the provided folder structure, the system will consist of the following components:

1. **Producer Service**: Responsible for data ingestion from external sources.
2. **Kafka Broker**: Message broker for data streaming between components.
3. **Consumer Stream Storage**: For future real-time data processing capabilities.
4. **Consumer Batch Processing**: Core component for batch data processing using Apache Spark.
5. **Consumer Dashboard**: Frontend interface for data visualization and monitoring.
6. **Consumer Trading Bot**: For automated trading based on processed data.
7. **Consumer Data Storage**: For writing data to persistent storage (PostgreSQL/MongoDB).
8. **Database**: For data persistence and retrieval.

## Project Phases
The project is divided into three phases:

1. **Conception Phase**: Research, design, and planning of the data architecture.
2. **Development Phase**: Implementation of the designed architecture.
3. **Finalization Phase**: Fine-tuning, reflection, and documentation.

## Current Focus: Conception Phase
The current focus is on the conception phase, which requires:
- Researching common software components for data-intensive applications
- Designing a reliable, scalable, and maintainable system
- Planning for data security, governance, and protection
- Selecting appropriate Docker images for each component
- Choosing a suitable sample dataset
- Creating a comprehensive architecture flow chart

## Key Decisions to Make
1. Which microservices will handle data ingestion?
2. Which microservices will handle data storage?
3. Which microservices will handle data pre-processing and aggregation?
4. Which microservices will handle data delivery to the frontend ML application?
5. What techniques will ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability?
6. What techniques will ensure data security, governance, and protection?
7. Which Docker images will be used for each component?
8. What sample data will be used for the project?
9. What will be the frequency of data ingestion, processing, aggregation, and delivery?

## Next Steps
After completing the requirements analysis, the next steps will involve researching data engineering components, designing the batch processing architecture, selecting a sample dataset, creating a detailed implementation plan, documenting architecture decisions, and preparing the conception phase deliverables.
