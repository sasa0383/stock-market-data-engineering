**Alternatives Considered**:
- Kubernetes for local development: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity
- Manual container management: Rejected due to operational overhead

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited to single-host deployment
- Not suitable for production deployment

### 9. Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

**Decision**: Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and management.

**Rationale**:
- Declarative configuration for infrastructure
- Version control of infrastructure changes
- Support for multiple cloud providers

## Conclusion

These architecture decisions provide a solid foundation for our batch-processing data architecture for stock market data. The decisions are aligned with the project requirements for reliability, scalability, maintainability, security, governance, and protection. The microservices approach with containerization enables independent development and deployment, while the batch processing model aligns with the quarterly update requirements of the machine learning application.

As we move forward with implementation, these decisions will guide the development process and ensure that the system meets all requirements. Regular reviews of these decisions will be conducted to ensure they remain appropriate as the system evolves.
